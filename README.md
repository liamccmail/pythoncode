# Python Code
This is where all my Python code I have written from Personal Projects to University Projects will be stored.

## Hello Fresh Python Projects
This is where I have stored all my files from my application process for a HelloFresh Job I had applied for in the past and had to complete a homework assignment for the process. I have left out the data they provided me with as it was confidential data.

## Python Projects
This is where I have stored my personal Python Projects where I have touched on some libraries which I found to be very useful.

## University Python Files
This is where I have stored all my Python files (that I had recovered) from University papers.

If you have any questions about my code or if you would like me to explain sections for your own use please email me at **lcun053@gmail.com**.
